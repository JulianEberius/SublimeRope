**SublimeRope**
===========================

Adds Python completions and some IDE-like functions to Sublime Text 2, through the use of the [Rope](http://rope.sourceforge.net/) library.

I have tested it on the latest dev build. It seems to work equally well on OSX, Linux and Windows, though I mostly test on OSX.
No guarantees here!
